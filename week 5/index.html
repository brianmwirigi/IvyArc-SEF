            <ol>
                <li value="1">This week’s task will borrow from the output of last week’s HTML Form task. Using HTML Tables,
                    create a tabular structure that stores the customer data that your HTML form of last week
                    collected. Your table should have at least three rows of data, i.e., imagine that at least three
                    people filled out your registration form.
                    You should also apply various CSS customization to your table, such as adding visible and table
                    borders, edited margins and paddings, making the table cells collapsed, etc. Show us your
                    creative side.
                    NOTE: This task will also enlighten you on how form data is typically stored in databases
                    (without the CSS part at least). This will be useful if you ever decide to become a Fullstack Web
                    Developer that effectively handles both Frontend and Backend programming.
                </li>
                <li>Create a scrollable picture gallery (containing at least three pictures) that illustrates various
                    pictures of your choosing. Give each picture a short descriptive block (or line) of text that easily
                    explains the message of your selected picture, and is positioned around your picture in a
                    caption-esque look.
                    NOTE: Your pictures should have a theme across them. For example, they can be about various
                    clay pots that details their history or craftsmanship or famous paintings that have impacted the
                    artistic world. Feel free to select any theme that you want, even if it’s something born from a
                    personal hobby. Feel free to be creative.
