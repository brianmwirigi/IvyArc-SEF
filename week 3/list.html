        <dt>Avengers: Endgame </dt>
        <dd> Thanos has caused a wide disaster as we saw at Infinity War (2018) when he wiped out nearly the half of the
            life across the universe. The rest of the Avengers have such a heavy millstone to overcome as they are on a
            date for a final round against him. Although it seems that the mission is so hard, they have to cooperate
            together to do whatever they can to spare what remain at the universe and restore the order. Meanwhile the
            hope becomes bigger when a new superhero with great powers joins the group.</dd>

        <dt>Avengers: Infinity War</dt>
        <dd>As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero
            to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his
            goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his
            twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate
            of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain. </dd>

        <dt>Batman The Dark Knight Rises</dt>
        <dd>Eight years after the Joker';s reign of anarchy, the Dark Knight is forced to return from his imposed exile
            to save Gotham City from the brutal guerrilla terrorist Bane. With allies being few and far away, Batman
            teams up with elusive jewel thief Selina Kyle,who may also be the key to stopping Bane. But whose side is
            she really on? </dd>

        <dt>Zack snyder's Justice League</dt>
        <dd>Determined to ensure Superman's ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne aligns forces with Diana
            Prince with plans to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of
            catastrophic proportions. </dd>
