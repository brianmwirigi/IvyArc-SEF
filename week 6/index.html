            <li value="1">For this week, you are to use what you have learnt this week to create a simple profile card
                that details your work experience
                (or school experience if you do not have much work experience) </li>
            <li>Like some older tasks, there are certain tools/techniques that you learnt that I would like to see you
                use in this task, namely:
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li value="i"> CSS Animations â€“ Animate at least one element in your webpage, specifying the various
                animation fields, such as iteration, fill mode, direction, etc that you studied this week </li>
            <li>The first-line pseudo-element</li>
            <li>The hover pseudo-class. Hint: This can be combined with the first-line pseudo-element
                to achieve a specific functionality shown in the presented profile card example that you
                were given above.
