            <li value="1">This week will focus on how you can apply responsive design to your web pages. It will borrow from
                some of your previous tasks. Letâ€™s get into it:
                Using the CSS Grid Layout, Meta Viewport, and CSS Media Queries (and any other relevant web dev
                tools that you've learnt, such as overflow and Drop-down Menu), create a simple movie review webpage
                that will host your reviews of at least six movies.
                The selected movies will be the ones that you used in your HTML List task.
                Each movie should have a picture that shows its movie poster, a title tag for it, and a short review of it
                using your own words (no dummy text, be creative).</li>
            </p>
            <p> <b>Additionally, a key functionality will be expected to be implemented: </b>
                <li>
                    When a user is operating from a device that has hovering capabilities, the titles of the movies should
                    change colour to one of your choosing (one that compliments the movie poster).
                    If the user's device does not hover, or if they are looking at the page as a print preview, then the default
                    colour of the titles should be your chosen colour </li>
            </p>
            <p> <b>Some helpful CSS properties-values, and media queries that will help you out: </b>
                <li value="1"> For the Grid Layout, look up the "fr" value, the repeat() function, minmax() function, and
                    autofit/autofill.</li>
                <li>For the reviews themselves, word-wrap: break-word.</li>
                <li>For the CSS Media Query, look up the screen and hover queries</li>
        </ol>
