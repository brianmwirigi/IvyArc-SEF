                Thanos has caused a wide disaster as we saw at Infinity War (2018) when he wiped out nearly the half of the
                life across the universe. The rest of the Avengers have such a heavy millstone to overcome as they are on a
                date for a final round against him. Although it seems that the mission is so hard, they have to cooperate
                together to do whatever they can to spare what remain at the universe and restore the order. Meanwhile the
                hope becomes bigger when a new superhero with great powers joins the group.

                As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero
                to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his
                goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his
                twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate
                of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain.
